## My process
- 1. Re-learn css properties/flexbox, grid.
- 2. Start working on the challenge with some help from youtube and google.
- 3. Abandond this challenge for a day because I was discouraged a litle bit.
- 4. Continue and finish.
### Built with

- Simple HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make an overlay.
```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
  background: url('');
}

.overlay {
  position: absolute;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  opacity: .6;
}
```

### Continued development
I would love to develop my css skills with flexbox and grid.
